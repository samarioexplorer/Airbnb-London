# Northwind-Database
In this project, I built a dashboard using open source service Metabase summarizing the Northwind Database. It is a sample database that is shipped along with Microsoft Access. The data is about “Northwind Traders”, a fictional company. The database contains all sales transactions between the company and its customers as well as purchases from Northwinds suppliers. Data was prepared by Paul Wlodkowski and available in his repository.
For this project, data was uploaded into Microsoft Access.
